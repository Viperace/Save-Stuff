# Game Rules

[Game Rules]
Each round of Bitcoin Fun lasts for 5 minutes. Result is announced and prizes are awarded at 3 minutes mark, follow by 2 minutes of rest. To win the prize, place your bet on the 3-minute direction of Bitcoin price (with reference to USD), whether it is up or down.

[Result, Prize & Odds]
✓ When the round begins, the bot will read the Bitcoin price from official website. On the result announcement at 3 minutes mark, the bot will read the Bitcoin price again. If the latter Bitcoin price is higher, then result is announced as "UP"; if lower, then the result is announced as "DOWN"; if the price is exactly same as the earlier price, then the result is "DRAW".
✓ Player can bet UP or DOWN.
✓ The odds is dynamic and is based on the number of players. In short, the winning side take all the bets from the losing side. The odds are computed as "total loser's bet divided by total winner's bet".  
✓ The house commission is 3%
✓ If the result is DRAW, all bets are returned to all players
✓ If one side (either UP or DOWN) has no bets at all, then the round is void. All bets are returned to all players
