Dear Sir/Madam,

I have an outstanding bill that I wish KKH to file with my Insurer Prudential.

The claim is for my son, LIEW ZI XUAN (birth cert: T1926457I), who was admitted for 1 night, and discharged on 21 Feb 2020
The Invoice #7620007898J, total amount $437.35. 

I have checked with my insurer, who advise that KKH should file the claim directly to them. Please advise if you are able to do so?

Best Regards,
Voon Hooi
