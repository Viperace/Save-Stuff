摘要
在数字时代，我们已经来到了一个不缺乏游戏选择的时代。无论是在个人电脑，游戏机，手机，平板 电脑还是手表上，都可以随时玩儿电子游戏。 在过去的三十年中，我们见证了电子游戏产业史无前 例的发展，从黑白画面的俄罗斯方块到虚拟现实头盔。电子游戏从最初挑战其他形式的娱乐到现在是最终的领导者。
google play或各大游戏app市场上个人开发者和小型团对占据了大部分的市场份额。目前最让开发者头疼的是如何开发一款具有内容且有趣的产品。但事实上，最大的困难是如何让开发的游戏产生赢利，大多开发者都通过广告及市场指定的内购方法来获取赢利，很多广告价格非常低廉通常最大的部分已经被广告发行商赚取，内购方式审核限制又非常多,平台的佣金也高得惊人。
ADSCoin平台提供了一套开创性的区块链系统,允许玩家或开发者能够从游戏中,社交活动以及WEB页面展示等方式收益,ADSCoin平台无需审核就能够快速接入提供加密货币帐户支付购买任意类型游戏及任意类型站点的物品等。

            Games distribution platform such as Google Play are dominated by individual developer and small size studio known as Indie. These developers all faced a similar problem – to create a fun and interesting product. The reality is however, most of these indies are faced with an uphill battle of making profit. Most indies try will try to advertise their products through commercial advertiser, who erode a large sum of their profit. To make matter worse, the indie also faced obstacle of placing their products onto the distribution platform - lengthy review time, hefty fees and commission.
            ADSCoin platform provides a revolutionary blockchain system, that is able to directly link players and developers from Social Media, website and other methods. ADSCoin platform does not requires review and can provide encrypted digital coin payment

ADSCoin 采矿
            ADS 于 BTC的规则是一样的, 核心原理是“区块链”，每一个区块对应一个帐单，将所有的区块链接起来就是区块链，任何交易信息和转账记录都记录在区块链中。要注意的是区块链分布在于整个互联网的集成了ADS的移动游戏和WEB节点中，所以任何ADS持有者都不担心ADS消失遭受损失。每隔一个时间点，ADS“区块链”系统会在系统节点上生成一个随机代码，互联网中的所有节点都可以去寻找此代码，谁找到此代码，就会产生一个区块，随即得到一个ADS。随机代码的获得是按整个系统的时间戳和客户端数量随机性获得的,也就是说,他并不依赖强大的算力.这点和BTC及其他的加密货币有很大区别,所以你不可能在用算力强大的矿机去计算出更多的ADS,相反如果你有多个节点那你可以会有机会获得更多的ADS,这样可以保证采矿的公平性.也就是说如果你使用承载ADS节点的应用越多,你获得得ADS的机会就越多.

ADSCoin Mining

The technology behind ADS and Bitcoin are rather similar. They are based on "Blockchain", where each block corresponds to a ledger of transaction, 
and all ledgers are joined together to form a Blockchain. All information of past and current transaction are recorded in Blockchain. 
The important thing to note is that the Blockchain is spread throughout different ADS points, run by ADS games and ADS websites.
As such, owners of ADS do not need to worry about the disappearance of their coins. 
At every period of time, ADS Blockchain will generate a puzzle locked by a random secret code. 
The puzzle is opened to the Internet and whoever found the secret code first will be rewarded with one ADS.
The code is randomly determined by the system time and the number of clients, and hence is not solvable by raw computing power.
This is the main difference between ADS and other Bitcoin type of cryptocurrency.
As such, users do not need powerful computing machine to mine for ADS. On the contrary, users with more ADS points 
will stand a higher chance in receiving more ADS. This ensures fairness among all ADS miners.
In short, if you are able to load more ADS Points, you will get more ADS.
